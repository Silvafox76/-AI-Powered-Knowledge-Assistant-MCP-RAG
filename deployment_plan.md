# Deployment Plan for AI-Powered Knowledge Assistant

This document outlines the considerations and a high-level plan for deploying the AI-Powered Knowledge Assistant to a cloud environment, focusing on scalability, reliability, and security. While the initial MVP is designed for local execution, a production-ready system will leverage cloud infrastructure.

## 1. Cloud Provider Selection

The choice of cloud provider (AWS, GCP, Azure) depends on existing organizational preferences, budget, and specific feature requirements. All major providers offer comparable services for the components identified in the architecture.

## 2. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

To ensure consistent, repeatable, and scalable deployments, Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools will be utilized. This allows for defining and provisioning all necessary cloud resources through code.

*   **Recommended Tools:**
    *   **Terraform:** Cloud-agnostic, supports AWS, GCP, Azure, and many other providers. Ideal for provisioning infrastructure.
    *   **CloudFormation (AWS), Deployment Manager (GCP), Azure Resource Manager (ARM) Templates:** Provider-specific IaC tools.

## 3. Backend Deployment (FastAPI Application)

The FastAPI backend will be containerized and deployed using container orchestration services.

*   **Containerization:** Docker will be used to create images for the FastAPI application.
*   **Orchestration:**
    *   **Kubernetes (EKS on AWS, GKE on GCP, AKS on Azure):** Recommended for production-grade, highly scalable, and resilient deployments. Provides features like auto-scaling, self-healing, and service discovery.
    *   **AWS ECS/Fargate, GCP Cloud Run, Azure Container Instances/Apps:** Simpler container services for smaller deployments or when full Kubernetes complexity is not required.
*   **Load Balancing:** A load balancer (e.g., AWS ALB, GCP Load Balancer, Azure Application Gateway) will distribute incoming traffic across multiple instances of the FastAPI application.
*   **Auto-scaling:** Configure auto-scaling policies based on CPU utilization, request latency, or custom metrics to dynamically adjust the number of running instances.

## 4. Data Storage Deployment

### Vector Database (ChromaDB)

*   **Managed Service:** For production, consider managed vector database services if available (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate Cloud, or dedicated vector search services from cloud providers). These offer scalability, backups, and operational ease.
*   **Self-Hosted on Cloud VM:** If a managed service is not chosen or available for ChromaDB, it can be deployed on a dedicated cloud Virtual Machine (e.g., AWS EC2, GCP Compute Engine, Azure VM) with persistent block storage (e.g., AWS EBS, GCP Persistent Disk, Azure Managed Disks).

### Relational Database (Supabase/PostgreSQL)

*   **Managed Database Service:** Highly recommended for PostgreSQL.
    *   **AWS RDS for PostgreSQL:** Fully managed relational database service.
    *   **GCP Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL:** Managed PostgreSQL service.
    *   **Azure Database for PostgreSQL:** Managed PostgreSQL service.
*   **Benefits:** Automated backups, patching, scaling, and high availability configurations.

### Object Storage (Raw Documents)

*   **Cloud Object Storage:** For storing raw ingested documents (PDFs, PPTX, DOCX, etc.).
    *   **AWS S3:** Highly durable, scalable, and cost-effective object storage.
    *   **GCP Cloud Storage:** Similar capabilities to S3.
    *   **Azure Blob Storage:** Microsoft's object storage solution.

## 5. Frontend Deployment (Gradio/React)

### Gradio (MVP)

*   Can be deployed on a small VM or as a container alongside the backend. Not typically suited for large-scale public-facing production due to its primary focus on rapid prototyping.

### React + Next.js (Production)

*   **Static Site Hosting:** For the Next.js frontend (after build), the static assets can be hosted on:
    *   **AWS S3 + CloudFront:** S3 for storage, CloudFront for CDN and global distribution.
    *   **GCP Cloud Storage + Cloud CDN:** Similar setup on GCP.
    *   **Azure Blob Storage + Azure CDN:** Similar setup on Azure.
*   **Server-Side Rendering (SSR) / API Routes:** If Next.js SSR or API routes are used, these components would run on serverless platforms or containers (e.g., AWS Lambda@Edge, GCP Cloud Functions, Azure Functions, or within the Kubernetes cluster).

## 6. Networking and Security

*   **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC):** Deploy all resources within a private, isolated network (VPC on AWS, VPC Network on GCP, VNet on Azure).
*   **Security Groups/Firewalls:** Configure network access controls to restrict traffic to only necessary ports and IP ranges.
*   **SSL/TLS:** Implement SSL/TLS certificates for all public-facing endpoints (load balancers, API gateways) to ensure encrypted communication.
*   **Identity and Access Management (IAM):** Use cloud provider IAM (e.g., AWS IAM, GCP IAM, Azure AD) to manage permissions for cloud resources. Follow the principle of least privilege.
*   **Secrets Management:** Store API keys, database credentials, and other sensitive information in a secure secrets manager (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, GCP Secret Manager, Azure Key Vault).

## 7. Monitoring and Logging

*   **Centralized Logging:** Aggregate logs from all application components and infrastructure into a centralized logging solution (e.g., AWS CloudWatch Logs, GCP Cloud Logging, Azure Monitor Logs).
*   **Application Performance Monitoring (APM):** Use APM tools (e.g., Datadog, New Relic, Prometheus/Grafana) to monitor application performance, identify bottlenecks, and track key metrics.
*   **Alerting:** Set up alerts for critical events (e.g., high error rates, low disk space, service downtime).

## 8. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

Automate the build, test, and deployment processes to enable rapid and reliable updates.

*   **Recommended Tools:**
    *   **GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, Jenkins, AWS CodePipeline, GCP Cloud Build, Azure DevOps Pipelines.**
*   **Pipeline Steps:** Code commit -> Build Docker image -> Run tests -> Push image to container registry -> Deploy to staging -> Run integration tests -> Deploy to production.

## 9. Backup and Disaster Recovery

*   **Data Backups:** Implement automated backup strategies for databases and object storage.
*   **Disaster Recovery Plan:** Define a plan for recovering from major outages, including RTO (Recovery Time Objective) and RPO (Recovery Point Objective).

This plan provides a foundation for a robust cloud deployment. Specific configurations will depend on the chosen cloud provider and detailed architectural decisions during the implementation phases.
